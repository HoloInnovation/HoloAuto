## Introduction

The Microsoft Hololens. The new mixed reality headset developed by Microsoft was brought in 2016 to the developers scene to offer a new platform for innovation.
As our 4th year engineering project, we decided to take that road to work with Actimage, a digital transformation expert group and work on a new technology that marries the virtual to the real world.

*Mixed reality (MR), sometimes referred to as hybrid reality, is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.
Mixed reality takes place not only in the physical world or the virtual world, but is a mix of reality and virtual reality, encompassing both augmented reality and augmented virtuality via immersive technology.*

Focused on innovation, we contacted several companies to show how mixed reality could benefit workers working on an industrial level. We focused our research on the automobile industry and got a contact: with the Quality Roadmap Team Leader at Renault who was interested in this new technology. We met at the Microsoft Experiences â€™17 in Paris and outlined the needs of the company. We came to conclusion that it would greatly benefit Renault to have a way to virtually visit a factory to not only train the workers but also record the environment and be able to share it to other workers in other factories.
Today companies are faced with a real problem. Assembly lines need to be optimized to guarantee security, and productivity.  That means that our idea could be deployed for other companies in the automobile industry as well as other companies in different domains.
For safety procedures, it would first greatly reduce the time for safety inspections.
A proper placement of the machines is essential. To fulfill the demand, we developed an application to enable us to modify in real time, the placement of the machines and visualize them while they are running.
We used and applied our engineering knowledge to build our team and the work around the project. Since this technology is still very new to the scene, a good part of our work  consisted in applying the principles of science and problem solving to move forward.
Today, after a year of research we are sharing our experience with the community providing a solid base of information to future developers.
